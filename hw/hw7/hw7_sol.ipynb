    "In lecture 17, we talked about natural language processing (NLP). Using pre-trained word embeddings is very common in NLP. It has been shown that pre-trained word embeddings work well on a variety of text classification tasks. These embeddings are created by training a model like Word2Vec on a huge corpus of text such as a dump of Wikipedia or a dump of the web crawl. \n",

    "### 2.1 Preprocessing using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "_Points:_ 8\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you'll prepare the data for topic modeling using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). Preprocessing is a crucial step before training an LDA model and it markedly affects topic modeling results. So let's carry out preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Write code to carry out preprocessing of the \"text\" column in the dataframe above and store the preprocessed text in a new column called \"text_pp\" in the dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is no such thing as \"perfect\" preprocessing. You'll have to make your own judgments and decisions on which tokens are more informative and which ones are less informative for the given task. Some common text preprocessing steps for topic modeling are: \n",
    "- getting rid of slashes or other weird characters\n",
    "- sentence segmentation and tokenization      \n",
    "- getting rid of urls and email addresses\n",
    "- getting rid of other fairly unique tokens which are not going to help us in topic modeling  \n",
    "- excluding stopwords and punctuation \n",
    "- lemmatization        \n",
    "\n",
    "You might have to go back and forth between the preprocessing and topic modeling and interpretation steps in the next exercises. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Check out [these available attributes](https://spacy.io/api/token#attributes) for `token` in spaCy which might help you with preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "> You can also get rid of words with specific POS tags. [Here](https://spacy.io/api/annotation/#pos-en) is the list of part-of-speech tags used in spaCy. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that preprocessing the corpus might take some time. So here are a couple of suggestions: 1) During the debugging phase, work on a smaller subset of the data. 2) Once you're done with the preprocessing part, you might want to save the preprocessed data so that you don't run the preprocessing part every time you run the notebook. \n"

    "- Decision Tree: This model is able to naturally handle multiclass classification. It does this by predicting the value of a target class by learning simple decision rules from the data features.\n",
    "- KNN: This model is capable of handling multiclass classification. It does this by finding the k-nearest neighbors based on a selected data point usually based on Euclidean distance (in this course). Then a class is assigned based on the majority class of the k-nearest neighbors.\n",
    "- Random Forest: This model is able to handle multiclass classification by default and extends the Decision Tree model. This model is able to do this by collecting the predictions of multiple decision trees and then determining the class based on the majority.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression: The model can be extended for multiclass classification however it will require techniques such as the one-versus-rest reduction as stated scikit-learn documentation.\n",

    "2. Transfer learning is a strategy where a model trained on one task is then repurposed to perform another similar task. In natural language processing or computer vision, this refers to training a model on a large dataset for a specific task, then the model is fine-tuned on a smaller dataset for a different but similar task. This knowledge transfer from tasks enables better performance even with limited labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Neural networks' property of performing multiple sequential transformations of data is useful in transfer learning. This is because in transfer learning, a pre-trained neural network which learned general features from a large dataset can be fine-tuned on a smaller dataset for a related task. The initial layers of the network, which extract basic features are useful for general tasks, while the layers after are fine-tuned to task-specific features. This property overall helps the model to effectively leverage knowledge from the source task thus improving performance on the target task with limited data.\n",
