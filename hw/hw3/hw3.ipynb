A side advantage of this would be that with a bigger test split, we'll have a more reliable estimate of the model performance!_"

    "In Exercise 2.3, we saw that there are 3 categorical features with missing values. So first we need to impute the missing values and then encode these features with one-hot encoding. For the purpose of this assignment, let's just have imputation as the first step for all categorical features even when they do not have missing values. This should be OK because if a feature doesn't have any missing value,  imputation won't be applied. \n",

    "If we want to apply more than one transformation on a set of features, we need to create a [`scikit-learn` `Pipeline`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html). For example, for categorical features we can create a `scikit-learn` `Pipeline` with first step as imputation and the second step as one-hot encoding. \n",

This will not necessarily give us a worse classifier, but we cannot truly evaluate its performance since the test data is now training data. We would have to collect more data to test the model with.\n",
    "3. It allows us to define a set of repeatable actions that we wish to apply to our data. It can also be treated as a model for us to easily perform cross-validation. Without pipelines, we'd have to perform cross-validation manually (making our own random splits, fitting the transformer to our training data, then transforming both the training and validation data), to avoid \"poisoning\" the transformer creation with the validation data.\n",
    "4. Datasets commonly have many features of different types, on which we will likely want to apply different transformations. For example, a dataset may have a mix of categorical and numerical features, on which we would apply some encoding or scaling respectively. A ColumnTransformer facilitates these transformations by allowing us to specify what transformations we want to apply to which columns individually, removing the need for us to apply transformations separately and reconstructing our dataframe afterwards.
